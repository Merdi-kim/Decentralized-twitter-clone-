# Twitter clone 

This is a decentralized twitter built on top of Lens protocol and ipfs.
We're keeping all the features of normal twitter but on a *decentralized architecture* .

To get started, do the following : 

- clone the repo
- cd into the repo 
- install all the dependeecies 

To run the project, type `npm run dev` in your terminal. Now your project is running on http://localhost:3000 

In order to be able to create profiles and post content, you'll need to set up a *.env* .
Inside that file, set your storage key like this `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_KEY= `.

ðŸš¨ The storage key in this case will be the key that we generate from [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) which is service for storing data on IPFS.

Now you can start to make changes to this project and I'll be more than happy to see your PRs. 

Happy coding ! ðŸ’»
